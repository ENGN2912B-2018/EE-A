## Introduction
This software provides two tools which may be used in a complementary fashion. First, we provide a software package targeted at a raspberry pi connected to an ADXL345 accelerometer. This will allow the user to input a number of samples to be collected from the accelerometer. The accelerometer runs at 3200 Hz, and each sample is collected in an internal 32 level FIFO, before being read by the raspberry pi over SPI. This software runs the samples through a Kalman filter and numerical integration to filter out error and get velocity and position from acceleration data. Then our software outputs the raw data collected from the accelerometer and the Kalman filtered data in two separate .csv files. The files can then be loaded into the GUI and analyzed. 


## Project Overview
## Goals and Objectives 
## Software Architectural Design
#### Required External Libraries
#### Functional Block Diagrams 
#### Data Flow Diagrams
#### Interface Descriptions
#### Installing Kalman Filter/Accelerometer Interface
To install the software on the raspberry pi:

```
 git clone https://github.com/ENGN2912B-2018/EE-A/  
 cd EE-A  
 mkdir build; cd build  
 cmake ..  
 make  
```
This will output an executable called spatial, which can be run by
```
 sudo ./spatial  
```
Note: sudo is important, otherwise you will get a "segmentation fault" error.

For installing the GUI, see the later 

#### Graphical Interface/Data Visualization 
In order to graphically display the position data before and after Kalman filtering, we created a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in Qt Creator version 5.10.1. Our GUI allows the user to read in a .csv file containing raw, 3 dimensional position data (units: m), specify the sampling rate, and display the axial position (x, y, or z, based on user selection) of the tracked object against time (unit: s). In addition to te aforementioned 2-dimensional plots, our data visualization application can also generate a 3-dimensional scatter plot that shows the x, y, and z points in space to give the user a sense for where the object has moved over the course of the movement trial. Detailed instructions for running our GUI can are located under the "Instructions for Compiling and Running the Software" section of the README.

###### Graphical Interface/Data Visualization
Our GUI was created using Qt Creator version 5.10.1 and made use of the QCustomPlot external library and the Qt Data Visualization module that comes with this version of the software. Everything was created and tested on the CCV; our executable file will run on any Linux machine, but will not on Windows and iOS devices. The instruction list below provides a comprehensive tutorial on how to run and build our GUI software application **in the CCV environment**: 
1. From the home directory, run the command *cd /gpfs/runtime/opt/qt/5.10.1/Tools/QtCreator/bin* to go to the directory where you may enter the Qt Creator environment through the command *./qtcreator*
2. Once the IDE opens, you will be taken to the Welcome screen where you can select the *Open Project* button. After you have downloaded our code, navigate to the directory it was downloaded to and go into the folder titled "EE_A_Data_Vis." Now select the available .pro file of the same name to open the project. 
3. From here, click build on the bottom left of the IDE and wait a few minutes for the files to be auto-generated by Qt. 
4. Click run and the GUI should pop up. From here, you may specify a .csv file (it must be in the same directory as the .pro and other files associated with the project) to read in, select a sampling rate, and then click the plot buttons to see 2D and 3D position data.

### Motivation
Tracking spatial position has become increasingly cheap over the years with the advent of satellite positioning, most recognizably exemplified by the widespread Global Positioning System. However cheap and compatible they are, GPS systems are not simple electronic devices. Our project seeks to implement robust positioning by applying Kalman filtering on data from a MEMS accelerometer on a Raspberry Pi.

### Libraries
- _**SPI**_ - C-Periphery
- _**FFT**_ - FFTW
- _**Visualization**_ - VTK and Qt
- _**Kalman Filtering**_ - Eigen, SourceForge "Kalman Filter"

### Applications
