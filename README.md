### Motivation
Tracking spatial position has become increasingly cheap over the years with the advent of satellite positioning, most recognizably exemplified by the widespread Global Positioning System. However cheap and compatible they are, GPS systems are not simple electronic devices. Our project seeks to implement robust positioning by applying Kalman filtering on data from a MEMS accelerometer on a Raspberry Pi.

### Libraries
- _**SPI**_ - C-Periphery
- _**FFT**_ - FFTW
- _**Visualization**_ - VTK and Qt
- _**Kalman Filtering**_ - Eigen, SourceForge "Kalman Filter"

### Applications
Biking Tracking and Building Sway
