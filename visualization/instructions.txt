The data visualization component of this project was compiled and built using Qt Creator, 
the instructions for which will be outlined in the Readme. The two folders here underneath 
the EE-A/visualization folder are the main Qt project folder containing the files we needed to run 
our GUI in Qt and the automatically generated build folder that Qt creator generates when you choose
to build. We chose to provide the executable file (EEA_Data_Vis) in the build_qt_creator_project so that 
the graders may run it in linux with ease.
